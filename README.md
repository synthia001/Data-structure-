Data Structures Implementation in Python
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures using Python.
It includes examples of both linear and non-linear data structures along with basic operations for each.

Implemented Data Structures
1. Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)
Description: A collection where the last element added is the first to be removed.
Operations: push(item), pop(), peek(), is_empty()
2. Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)
Description: A collection where the first element added is the first to be removed.
Operations: enqueue(item), dequeue(), is_empty()
3. Linked List
Description: A linear data structure where elements are nodes connected by pointers.
Operations: insert(data), display()
4. Binary Tree
Description: A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children.
Traversal: Inorder traversal implemented.
5. Graph (Adjacency List)
Description: Represents relationships between nodes using adjacency lists.
Operations: add_edge(u, v), display()
How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
